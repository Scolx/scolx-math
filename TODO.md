# Scolx Math API - Development Roadmap

## Completed Features
- ✅ Hardened plain-text mathematical operations (integration, differentiation, solving equations, simplification, limits, series)
- ✅ FastAPI-based REST API with request validation and error handling
- ✅ Step-by-Step explanations for mathematical operations
- ✅ LaTeX parsing support
- ✅ Support for both plain text and LaTeX expressions
- ✅ Integration with SymPy for symbolic computation
- ✅ Example usage code
- ✅ High-level documentation (README + docs/)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (API, LaTeX, and smoke tests)
- ✅ Safe expression parsing with whitelisted functions and constants
- ✅ Optional SymEngine acceleration for faster computations
- ✅ Support for limits and series expansion (both plain text and LaTeX)
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation for all operations

## Planned Features
- ✅ Enhanced LaTeX parsing with more comprehensive support
- ✅ Support for multivariate calculus
- ✅ Matrix and linear algebra operations
- ✅ Plotting and visualization capabilities
- ✅ Support for differential equations
- 🔲 Complex number operations
